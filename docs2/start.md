# CATChem

## Description

The Configurable ATmospheric Chemisty (CATChem) component
that includes all chemical and aerosol processes needed to perform
atmospheric chemistry and composition simulations within a model
through a flexible, easy to modify, and well-documented infrastructure.
CATChem will include the following processes:
chemical kinetics, aerosols, photolysis, wet deposition, dry deposition,
connections to emissions, and connection to physics schemes.
The first use of CATChem will be connecting it to NOAA's
Unified Forecasting System (https://ufscommunity.org/) to create UFS-Chem.
CATChem and UFS-Chem are currently under development and more information will be provided soon.

## Warning

CATChem is currently under development.
The code is public to encourage collaboration amongst the community.
Do not publish results using CATChem without consulting the development team.

## Developer's Guide

### Description of Branches

#### main

This is the parent branch which
consolidates the current development in the repository.

#### release-vX.Y.Z

These represent stable release branches.
Users should always check out the most recent stable release branch
when cloning the repository.

### How to incorporate updates to CATChem

In order to contribute code to CATChem, you will need to fork the
repository, make changes on your fork, and submit a pull request with your
changes.

1. Fork the GitHub repository to your own GitHub account
   using the "Fork" button near the top right of
   <https://github.com/ufs-community/CATChem>.

   **NOTE:** You can pull updates from the main repository
   by using the "Fetch Upstream" button on your fork.
   Alternatively (see cloning notes below):
   ```
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:ufs-community/CATChem.git
   $ git pull upstream main
   $ git push origin main
   ```

2. Navigate on your working machine
   to where you would like to keep the CATChem code
   (e.g. in your work location) and clone (see cloning notes below) your fork:
   ```
   $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:$GitHubUsername/$ForkName.git
   ```

3. Checkout the develop branch --- you need to do this with the remote branch
   as well as create a local tracking branch::
   ```
   $ git checkout origin/develop
   $ git checkout develop
   ```

4. Make changes to your fork, ideally in a new branch off of develop:
   ```
   git checkout -b <new branch name>
   ```

5. Submit a pull request back to the main CATChem repository (<https://github.com/ufs-community/CATChem>)
   with your changes.

6. Select two code reviewers (see list under development team section).

7. Once those two reviewers approve the code, it can be merged into the develop branch.

#### Cloning

Note that in order to do an SSH clone, e.g.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ufs-community/CATChem.git
```

you must have already
[added an SSH key] (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
to your GitHub account for your current machine.
If you are new to GitHub, check out
[this GitHub tutorial](https://jlord.us/git-it/).
We recommend the SSH method, but if you don't add an SSH key
you can still clone the repositories via HTTPS, e.g.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ufs-community/CATChem.git
```

## How to Add a New Process

CATChem is developed to be able to be easily extinsible with new processes.
There are just a few steps that are required to be able to include a new process.

- First create a new directory under src/process for your new process
  ```
  cd src/process
  mkdir src/process/<new process>
  ```

- Each process should include a process driver named `CCPr_<new process>_Mod.F90`.
  You can find a template under `src/process/Process_driver_template.F90`.
  In it, each process driver contains three phases:
  * Init: Processes the config and initializes process defaults if activated
  * Run: Runs the process and adds to `DiagState` and `ChemState` for any process
  * Finalize: Deallocate any arrays that were allocated.

- Each process should include a common module for any functions that may be used by schemes
  (sub-parameterizations or common calculations between different schemes in that process family).
  It also houses the process type and data information.

- Each process then can have one or more schemes within them.
  An example can be seen under `src/process/dust` and a template.
